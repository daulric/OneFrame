# Welcome to OneFrame

## What is OneFrame?
OneFrame is a module that allows developers to run multiple modular code under one server / client.

It was designed to give developers a sense of ease when making games and other projects.

## Why Choose OneFrame
There was a problem with games always scripts all over the place. The solution was to run all codes under one server / client without anything breaking!

This module was created to be:

- Fast
- Reliable
- More Organized
- Promise Implementation (by evaera)

## Installation
You can download OneFrame package straight from Wally.
